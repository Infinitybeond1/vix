  Opens `path` for reading, returns an instance of `t:Vix.Vips.Image.t/0`

  It can load files in many image formats, including VIPS, TIFF, PNG, JPEG, FITS, Matlab, OpenEXR, CSV, WebP, Radiance, RAW, PPM and others.

  Load options may be appended to filename as "[name=value,...]". For example:

  ```elixir
  Image.new_from_file("fred.jpg[shrink=2]")
  ```
  Will open "fred.jpg", downsampling by a factor of two.

  The full set of options available depend upon the load operation that will be executed. Try something like:

  ```shell
  $ vips jpegload
  ```
  at the command-line to see a summary of the available options for the JPEG loader.

  Loading is fast: only enough of the image is loaded to be able to fill out the header. Pixels will only be decompressed when they are needed.

  Make a VipsImage which, when written to, will create a temporary file on disc.

  The file will be automatically deleted when the image is destroyed. format is something like `"%s.v"` for a vips file.

  The file is created in the temporary directory. This is set with the environment variable TMPDIR. If this is not set, then on Unix systems, vips will default to `/tmp`. On Windows, vips uses `GetTempPath()` to find the temporary directory.
